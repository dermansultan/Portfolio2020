            This was my first go at creating a full on JavaScript 'application'.
            Before this I had only expiremented with coding applications that
            were narrow in scope such as a weight calculator or tic tac toe{" "}
            <SpanPara>(you can see those on my github!).</SpanPara> I set out to
            create a ToDoList with <SpanPara>Vanilla JavaScript</SpanPara> in
            hopes of learning a few new technologies.

            Through this personal project I was able to learn quite a few useful
            skills. To save on bundle size I used <SpanPara>Webpack</SpanPara>{" "}
            for the very first time. This was quite the challenge as I had never
            used NPM or a bundler before. I was able to get Webpack up and
            running (through their amazing documentation page) , setting up
            scripts within my package.json, and configuring webpack to support
            plugins such as font and css loaders.
          </BodyPara>
          <BodyPara>
            I practiced <SpanPara>code-splitting</SpanPara> and had worked with an external module
            for the first time. Previously I had never seperated my code into
            seperate modules. As I wasn't relying on a JavaScript framework I
            had to split up my code into seperate modules since how 'manual' DOM
            manipulation can be. I used date-fns library to make formatting
            dates a little easier on the user side.
          </BodyPara>
          <BodyPara>
            I chose to keep all the user data within{" "}
            <SpanPara>local storage</SpanPara> as I intended for this project to
            be mainly practice. The users 'projects' fall under objects which
            contain tasklists arrays within them. Each task is an object that
            holds different key value pairs such as title, description, due date
            etc.

            Compared to today's frameworks using vanilla javascript felt tedious
            but rewarding. It really helped me solidify my understanding of the
            fundamentals. Creating functions that made div wrappers manually
            really helped me realize how fortunate we are to use the map method
            with React Components.

            Storing the users list in Google Firebase or learning how to host
            and build out my own backend, or even dabbling with some css +
            promise based animations.
