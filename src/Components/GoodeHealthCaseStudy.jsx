            During Fall of 2021 I worked alongside the Lumber team to redevelop one of our client's (Goodehealth) applications. The agency would be responsible for porting over the existing product to
            a new tech stack, and an overhaul to the user experience.

            Goodehealth offers two main products. A blood test kit and a superfood blend to go with it. The blood test kit is sent off to a lab where through their application users can see in depth
            data about their health.
            <br /> <br />
            This data includes biomarkers and suggestions on how they can improve their health. These biomarkers offer a way for users to truly understand aspects of their health they need to focus on
            improving. <br /> <br />
            Goodehealth's main goal is to provide a personalized health experience that is approachable to a non health savvy audience. The application broad scope ranges from educating the user how
            to improve their health, recommending them purchases from their product lines and finally a way to visual the data the lab tests give to the users.

              On this project I was tasked to help facilitate the design side of the redevelopment. I worked alongside both the Goodehealth, and Lumber team to communicate and collaborate on design. I
              lead the project's initial user experience redesign push.
              <br /> <br />I was to communicate and receive feedback on design decisions with the Goodehealth team. This would include weekly chats with their team to gain insights on their product
              goals, it's customers and their key performance indicators.

            </WrapperCol>
            <BodyPara>
              I would also collaborate with our own team's developers to ensure the design of the product was clearly understood. This was done through Design QA documents, and flow walkthrough calls.
              There were other stakeholders that were collaborated with throughout the process but these were the oneâ€™s I would deal with day to day.
              <br /> <br />
              Overall I would say my role was cross functional as I acted as the glue between the business side and engineering.

            Kicking off the redevelopment, the developers were to assigned recreate the backend with a new tech-stack. I won't go into the nitty gritty details of that because, after all this is a
            design case study.
            <br />
            <br />
            But during this phase calls with the developers better helped me contextualize the limitations we could face with aspects of the application. This helped me rationalize design choices I
            was going to make.
            <br />
            <br />
            Although In the end the developers were able to plan out a more modern stack that would aid our design efforts.

            <SpanPara>During this time, my team simultaneously would start the process of the redesign. The research process was informed as follows: </SpanPara>

                The goal here was to identify glaring issues with clarity as health products can be overwhelming or confuse their less informed users. This would also gain us a few notes to keep in
                mind for when the design system was to be created.

            Conducting remote interviews really put me on the spot, but I was able to find my footing. I did my best to let conversations free-flow so I could gain unique insights from each of my
            interviews. Often I would get similar opinions but frustrations that varied. Each interview provided me with new perspectives that I could incorporate into our brain-storming.
