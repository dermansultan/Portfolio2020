              On this project I was tasked to help facilitate the design side of
              the redevelopment. I worked alongside both the Goodehealth, and
              Lumber team to communicate and collaborate on design.{" "}
              <strong>
                I led the project's initial user experience redesign push.
              </strong>
              <br /> <br />I was to communicate and receive feedback on design
              decisions with the Goodehealth team. This would include weekly
              chats with their team to gain insights on their product goals,
              it's customers and their key performance indicators.

              I would also collaborate with our own team's developers to ensure
              the design of the product was clearly understood. This was done
              through Design QA documents, and flow walkthrough calls. There
              were other stakeholders that were collaborated with throughout the
              process but these were the oneâ€™s I would deal with day to day.
              <br /> <br />
              <strong>
                Overall I would say my role was cross functional as I acted as
                the glue between the business side and engineering.

            Kicking off the redevelopment, the developers were to assigned
            recreate the backend with a new tech-stack. I won't go into the
            nitty gritty details of that because, after all this is a design
            case study.
            <br />
            <br />
            But during this phase, calls with the developers better helped me
            contextualize the limitations we could face with aspects of the
            application.{" "}
            <strong>
              This helped me rationalize design choices I was going to make.

            Although In the end the developers were able to plan out a more
            modern stack that would aid our design efforts.

            With this phase the goal was to create a low fidelity prototype of
            the mobile version of the application. We would eventually present
            this to the Goodehealth team for feedback. There were a number of
            considerations to be made as the application was an in browser

          <BodyPara>
            It was here where our team would set out to create a design system.
            This was mainly handled by my design team member YP with feedback
            based on various teams members such as developers, myself and some of
            the Goodehealth team. She created a sleek modern design system that
            matched modern day health applications while tying in aspects of
            their own branding.
            <br />
            <br />
            This system would help us easily iterate upon any pages or features
            that were missed in the original design planning phase. We also
            wanted to offer the developers a few pointers within the system. We
            included grid systems, components, modals, and much more with
            annotated captions.
            <br /> <br />
            During this phase we also were able to create concrete design
            components that were more ambiguous during the low fidelity
            wireframe stage. One thing we wanted to nail was navigation.

            Navigation can be a bit challenging on a browser application as
            different mobile devices allow for different allowances to the top
            bar. We ended up with a bar that would follow the user and hide
            itself when not interacted with.

            <br /> <br />
            We consulted with the Goodehealth team, presenting a high fidelity
            prototype to them. From here we got some feedback that helped us
            align on the logic of the score. We had lengthy calls with them
            explaining the nuances of each individual biomarker and their
            sections. It was nice to get a health professionals feedback and
            input on this design, as it was something I wasnâ€™t totally educated
            on. We implemented these changes easily thanks to the design system.

              One being that since this was a complete overhaul of their

            Personally I would've liked a few extra weeks for the initial design
            phase to hammer out some issues that were eventually solved in phase
            2. This was totally expected as we're not a large team, and that we
            had a deadline to reach.
            <br />
            <br />
            Having a tight timeline was also the reason we weren't able to
            conduct usability testing in the wild. As we are still working with
            the Goodehealth team and the product is freshly launched.{" "}
            <strong>
              I hope to reaffirm the design decisions we made in the process in
              the future (with usability testing), as the next piece of the
              puzzle will be their ecommerce site.

            <br /> <br />
            That being said I personally learned I should voice my opinion more
            during design sprints. Especially if I feel as if we needed more
            time.
            <br />
            <br />
            Overall I was very satisfied with the final product we were able to
            deliver. I learned a lot in terms of what to take into consideration
            when designing for the web. Working with a solid team of developers
            that had great communication. I was able to bug them about specifics
            and always get a detailed and informative answer.
