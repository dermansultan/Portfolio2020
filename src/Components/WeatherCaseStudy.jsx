            Another front-end project. This time I set out to learn some React
            and work with some sort of API to handle data. I decided on using
            Open-Weather. This was my first time using a framework as well as
            recieving data from a server. I was able to learn{" "}
            <SpanPara>JSON Responses</SpanPara>, the{" "}
            <SpanPara>Fetch API</SpanPara>, and many different{" "}
            <SpanPara>React</SpanPara> quirks.

            I learned to better visualize React{" "}
            <SpanPara>component structure</SpanPara> and then transfer it over
            in code. It was great to finally be able to map data to a component
            and see it stay up to date with State. I also messed a bit with
            conditional rendering.

            I did a deep dive into JavaScript promises with You Don't Know JS,
            and learned as much as I could about the{" "}
            <SpanPara>Fetch API</SpanPara>. I was able to recieve the data
            needed for the users search and store it as an object in state.

            React is cool! Since this project I've delved deeper into the React
            family messing around with hooks and styled-components. I'm hoping
            to dive into more projects with React in the future.
